This app is a replica of the YouTube website. I got inspiration for the app from the following tutorial done by @safak, owner of the [LamaDev channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LamaDev) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com). The LamaDev channel has dozens of amazing tutorials to help you with React and JavaScript development, and I highly recommend it to those wishing to learn React!
